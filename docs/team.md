I am a dual major in Computer Science and Geography at the University of Alabama, with a strong interest in the intersection of software development, spatial data, and geospatial analysis. My academic and project experience includes working with web development, databases, and GIS tools, as well as applying computational methods to spatial and environmental problems. In this project, I focus primarily on backend development and systems design, helping shape the technical architecture and geospatial components of the application.
