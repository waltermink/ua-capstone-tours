# UA Capstone Tours

UA Capstone Tours is a CS 495 Capstone project focused on developing a mobile-friendly digital walking tour of the University of Alabama campus.

The goal of the project is to create an interactive web application that allows users to explore campus buildings and landmarks through a map-based interface, combining geospatial data with descriptive text and, eventually, media such as photos and audio. The system is designed to support both on-campus, location-aware use and remote browsing, while also providing a framework for curated tours and future user-contributed content.
